# IPC Message Queues Monitoring for SVFE
#
# Purpose: Get current status of IPC message queues used by 
#          SVFE application's processes, such as nwint, epayint, tcpcomms, etc. 
#          This script will return amount of messages in a waiting status and 
#          receiver's process name for each IPC message queue. 
#
# Version: v1.0
# Develop: Fedor Ivanov | Unlimint
# Release: Nov 2022
# 
# See more, especially about IPC usage, in README.md file
